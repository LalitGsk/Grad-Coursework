Designed a Matlab-Simulink GNC model for an unmanned ground vehicle to navigate through given waypoints. 
Imposed a PID controller mechanism to the GNC model to mitigate the error rates of vehicle navigation. 
Simulated the GPS and compass sensor inputs to GNC model with slippage to support the Dead Reckoning failure.
