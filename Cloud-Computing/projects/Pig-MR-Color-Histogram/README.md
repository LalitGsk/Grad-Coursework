Project Description You are asked to implement Project 1 (histogram of pixels) using Apache Pig. Your Pig script should read an input pixel file as in Project 1. The data files are exactly the same as in Project 1.

In your Pig script, you can access the path of the input pixels file as '$P' and the output path as '$O'. That is, you can use LOAD '$P' USING ..., to load the pixels and STORE X INTO '$O' ..., to write the relation X to the output directory.

To run it in local mode over the small pixels file use:

sbatch histogram.local.run This will process the histogram on the small dataset pixels-small.txt and will write the result in the directory output. These results should be similar to the results in the file solution-small.txt. After you make sure that your program runs correctly in local mode, you run it in distributed mode using: sbatch histogram.distr.run This will process the histogram on the large dataset pixels-large.txt and will write the result in the directory output-distr. These results should be similar to the results in the file solution-large.txt.

Develop your project If you'd prefer, you may use your laptop to develop your program and then test it and run it on Comet.

To install Pig and the project:

cd wget http://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache/pig/pig-0.16.0/pig-0.16.0.tar.gz tar xfz pig-0.16.0.tar.gz wget http://lambda.uta.edu/cse6331/project6.tgz tar xfz project6.tgz You may use Pig on your laptop in local mode interactively: ~/pig-0.16.0/bin/pig -x local Go to project6/examples and look at the join.pig example. You can run it in local mode using: rm -rf output ~/pig-0.16.0/bin/pig -x local join.pig The results will be in the directory output. To run project6 in local mode: cd ~/project6 rm -rf output ~/pig-0.16.0/bin/pig -x local -param P=pixels-small.txt -param O=output histogram.pig
